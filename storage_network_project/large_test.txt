Line 1: This is a test of the distributed storage network system.
Line 2: We are testing file chunking and transfer between nodes.
Line 3: Each chunk is 1MB in size, so we need a larger file.
Line 4: The system uses TCP-style windowing with 3 chunks at a time.
Line 5: After sending 3 chunks, we wait for acknowledgments (ACKs).
Line 6: This ensures reliable file transfer over the network.
Line 7: Each node has 15GB of storage capacity.
Line 8: Files are saved to real folders on disk.
Line 9: The cloud service tracks all active nodes.
Line 10: Nodes send heartbeats every 30 seconds to stay alive.
